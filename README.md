# Typing Tutor

Recently, I got a new keyboard. 
However this keyboard is a bit odd, so I need to fix the way that I type.
The goal with typing tutor is to generate words that you can use to type against in the styple of a typing test.
The words generated are based on what keys you need to practice.

Hopefully you will find it a useful tool to practice adjustments to your typing style.
